Handset Detection is a service that lets you Detect Mobile Browsers. Our Database has over 50,000 handsets and growig at 60 to 80 new handsets per day. This is particularly useful if you want to target the ever growing number mobile users.

Sources are in HD3lib.

Binaries are in HD3Web/obj/Release/HD3.dll - Grab the dll from there and install where appropriate.

You can unzip and install on IIS as an application.

Happy Detecting.
