Hi,

Welcome to the HandsetDetection.com .NET APi Kit.
This is an API Kit for HandsetDetection's API v3.

Sources are in HD3lib.
Binaries are in HD3Web/obj/Release/HD3.dll - Grab the dll from there and install where appropriate.
Examples are in HD3web/*.aspx

You can unzip and install on IIS as an application.

If you need a hand with anything then drop an email to hello@handsetdetection.com

Happy Detecting.

Cheers
